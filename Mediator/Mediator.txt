DEFINITION

The intent of this pattern is to define an object-the mediator-that
encapsulates how a set of objects interact.It does that by forcing
objects to communicate via that mediator. Hence it promotes loose
coupling.

Mediator defines an interface for with Colleague communicating objects.

Colleague knows its Mediator and communicates with it instead
of with another Colleague.

ConcreteMediator knows and maintains its Colleagues,and it
implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects.
